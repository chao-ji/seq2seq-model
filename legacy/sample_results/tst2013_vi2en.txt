When I was a kid , I think <unk> is the best country in the world , and I often sing , &quot; We have nothing to do . &quot;
I was very proud of my country .
In school , we spend a lot of time studying the course of <unk> Kim <unk> , but not so much about the outside world , except from America , Korea and Japan are our enemies .
Although I &apos;ve ever wondered what the world is out there , but I still think that I &apos;m going to spend my life in <unk> , until everything is changing .
When I was seven years old , I witnessed the scene that people were going first while in my life , but I still thought my life was completely normal .
My family is not poor , and I am not <unk> .
But one day of 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a <unk> sister .
And then he wrote this : When you read these lines , all five of their friends had no longer in their life , because they had nothing to eat for two weeks .
It &apos;s all on the floor , and our bodies are weak to feel like death dying .
I was shocked .
Because that was the first time I knew my cell was suffering .
Shortly after that , when I went through a station , I saw an incredible picture I could never forget .
On the garage of the accelerator , he was holding a tiny <unk> <unk> , and the child knew staring at her face .
But nobody helped them , because they &apos;re all concerned for themselves and family .
In the middle of the 1990s , North Korea underwent a severe famine .
It makes more than one million Koreans die of hunger , and many people survive to eat grass , pests and bark .
The electric <unk> is happening often , so everything around me is dark at night , except for light light from the Chinese to just my home .
I always wondered why they got electricity and we wouldn &apos;t .
This is a photograph from North Korea in the same night with surrounding countries .
This is the <unk> <unk> border of North Korea and China .
You can see that the river has a narrow stage , so some North Korea <unk> <unk> Chinese .
But many people died .
And I saw them in the river .
I couldn &apos;t talk specifically about how I &apos;ve fled North North Korea , so I can &apos;t tell you that in the years of <unk> , I was sent to China to live with a <unk> .
At that point , I just thought I &apos;d have to get away from my family a short time .
I could never imagine that I would have to get 14 years away from them .
In China , life &apos;s life was isolated from her family as I was very difficult .
I had no idea what happened to the life of a refugee from North Korea who was going to be , but I soon realized that it wasn &apos;t very difficult , but it was incredibly dangerous , because the refugees from North Korea in China were all considered civic immigrants .
I always live in a <unk> fear that my identity will be detected , and I &apos;m going to be returned to the old life in North Korea .
One day , the nightmare was really true , and I was taken by the Chinese police and took the police to the police .
Someone told them that I was North Koreans , so they tested my Mandarin ability and asked me a lot of questions .
I was terrified , and it felt like my heart was going to explode .
Because if they saw anything , I &apos;d get ready to jail and get paid back to water .
I think my life is over , but I still try to control my emotions and answer their questions .
After all , one of the two cops said to him , this is a false point .
It &apos;s not North Korea . &quot;
And they released me . That was a miracle .
And some North Korea in China have gone to the embassy embassy to help refugees , but many of them were caught by the Chinese police and being returned to the water .
These girls are very lucky .
Because even though it was caught , but finally finally released due to the <unk> of international communities .
But these Koreans are not very lucky .
<unk> of North Korea were arrested in China and being returned to water , where they were tortured , <unk> or <unk> .
While I was lucky enough that I was very lucky to release a lot of my own <unk> .
North Koreans have to mask their identity and struggle to survive a tragedy .
Even when they &apos;ve learned Chinese and find a job , their lives can be totally <unk> within a moment .
That &apos;s why 10 years after the <unk> that I decided to take my risk to South Korea , to start a new life .
<unk> is much more difficult than I imagined .
In Korea , English has an incredibly important place , so I started learning English , my third language .
I also realized that there was a huge gap between South and North Korea .
We &apos;re all Koreans , but it &apos;s been very different from the back of 67 years .
I have experienced a crisis of my origins .
Am I South Korea or North Korea ?
Where did I come from ? Where am I ?
Suddenly , I had no country to be proud of called the U.N. .
And although I want to meet the living life in South Korea , it &apos;s not easy for me to make a plan .
He started learning to prepare for college .
And yet , as soon as I &apos;ve been used to life here , I get a terrible news .
North Korea has discovered the amount of money I sent home to my family , and , to punish them , they &apos;ll get my family back to a rural distance .
And so they could quickly escape from that , and I started planning to support my family .
North Koreans have to overcome distances that seem impossible to come with freedom .
Because <unk> from North to South Korea is almost impossible , so I have to fly China and then go back to North Korea border .
Because my family didn &apos;t know Chinese , so I had to travel around 2,000 miles in China and then to East Asia .
The journey with bus bus was about a week , and several times as much as we were .
Once , our cars are <unk> and <unk> by a Chinese police officer .
He <unk> everybody &apos;s letter , and he starts investigating .
Because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , so I thought they &apos;d be arrested .
When the police arrived near them , I immediately got up and told him that these are the <unk> I had to go with .
He looked at me very suspicious , but fortunately he believed me .
And we went on to the <unk> border , and I had to use nearly the entire <unk> of money that I had to pay to the <unk> border .
However , after we passed the border , my family was caught in jail for <unk> .
After I applied the fine and gave the bribe , my family was released in a month , and then again <unk> .
That was the greatest time in my life .
I did all kinds of ways to bring my family to freedom , and I &apos;d like to succeed , but they were caught up when we were only left the Korean <unk> .
I went back to the <unk> and the police , desperate to find a way to get my family out of that , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay or pay in trouble .
I was absolutely desperate .
At that point , there was a man who asked me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was incredibly surprised when a stranger was totally <unk> interested in asking me .
In plain English and a dictionary , I told him the context of my family , not a little bit of <unk> , the man went to the <unk> , pay all the money to my family and two other Korean South Korea .
I was thanking him by his heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why do you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t help her , &quot; He replied .
&quot; I am saving North Korea . &quot;
I realized that it was a <unk> moment in my life .
<unk> from strangers became a new vision of hope for me and the people in North Korea who needed it , and he showed me that kindness from strangers and support of international communities were the hopeful of hope that North Korea was looking for .
Finally , after a long journey , and my family was reunited in South Korea , but it was only half of the fight .
Many North Koreans are being divided with their families , and when they come to another country , they have to start with very little or less money .
So we can get aid from international communities for education , training English , teaching jobs , and many other areas .
We can also act as a bridge between those who are in North Korea with the outside world , because there &apos;s so many of us who are keeping contact with other families in the country , and we share them with information and money to be able to change North Korea from the inside .
I was incredibly fortunate to get a lot of help and to be inspired throughout my life , so I wanted to be able to fit to my country an opportunity to develop with the support of international support .
I believe that you will see more and more North Korea succeeded in every place in the world , including at TED stage .
Thank you .
I have a request today .
Please , don &apos;t tell me that I was normal .
Now I want to introduce you to my brother .
<unk> 22 , high and very handsome .
I didn &apos;t speak , but I gave the joy in the way that even some best scientists couldn &apos;t do .
<unk> knows what love is .
He shared it in a <unk> way , no matter how much .
She wasn &apos;t greedy . She was no color apart .
You don &apos;t care about religion , and let &apos;s understand : He hasn &apos;t lied .
When I sing the songs from my childhood , trying to remember the words that I can &apos;t , but I can &apos;t tell you that we know how little brains are , and how we don &apos;t know how wonderful it is .
Samuel was <unk> . She was very good-looking .
I had a <unk> memory .
But it &apos;s also selective .
I don &apos;t remember whether I was able to <unk> my <unk> , but I remember the year of every single song on my iPod , the conversation between us from the four , <unk> on my hands on the <unk> , and the birthday of Lady <unk> .
These things sound great , right ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because of my mind that I don &apos;t fit with the ordinary social version , they are often overlooked and <unk> .
But what gets my heart lighter and my heart is more powerful than that , although this is true , whether they &apos;re not considered normal , this can only mean that you are extraordinary -- autistic people -- autistic people .
Now , you don &apos;t get very familiar with saying , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is a brain brain brain which affects the ability to communicate social communication , learning and sometimes <unk> .
The symptoms of every individual , which is why <unk> is very different .
And all over the world , just 20 minutes have a patient diagnosed with autism , and even though it &apos;s one of the fastest developmental disorders in the world , we don &apos;t know either or treatment .
And I couldn &apos;t remember my first time with autism , but I couldn &apos;t remember one day without it .
I was three years old when my brother came out and I was incredibly excited that there was another one in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that I was different .
She &apos;s screaming .
I didn &apos;t want to play like other boys , and in fact , I didn &apos;t seem to have any interest to me or anything .
<unk> and <unk> in his own world , his own rules , and you see the joy of the <unk> , like blocks around the room and stare at the washing machine and eat whatever it &apos;s in your grasp .
When they grow up , they become different , and the difference becomes clearer .
But beyond <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> is something that is truly unique : pure and naive , a boy who looks at his life without prejudice , a man who has never lied .
<unk> .
Well , I can &apos;t deny that there was a few moments of <unk> in my family , these moments I wished they were just like me .
But I put my memory back to what he taught me about my personality , the conversation and love , and I realize that these are things that I &apos;m not going to do .
<unk> often missed the beauty that the difference for us and the other thing that we &apos;re otherwise , is nothing wrong with us .
It just means that there is one right .
And if I can only convey one thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you , that &apos;s you don &apos;t make peace .
You can be extraordinary .
Because with autism or not , the difference between us -- we have a gift ! Everyone brings us a gift , and honestly , in pursuit of normal average is the greatest sacrifice .
Social opportunity , progress and change are <unk> when we try to become like another .
Please -- don &apos;t say I was normal .
Thank you .
You &apos;ll all agree with me this is a beautiful street .
It &apos;s built out of asphalt , and asphalt are the kind of vehicles that run on it , but it &apos;s not always the case , especially not at all of these days as it is rains .
Then you can get water on a <unk> .
And especially if you bike , and you get through these cars , it &apos;s really not nice .
Also , plastics produce much noise .
It &apos;s a material material , if we do the streets of the Netherlands , very close to cities , we want a quiet path .
The solution to the problem is to make the streets from asphalt .
<unk> is the material we currently currently use to build most of the <unk> in the Netherlands , and it &apos;s <unk> and water just goes through <unk> so that all the rain is going to come out , and you have a convenient road to drive . So there &apos;s no more <unk> .
And it also disappeared through the <unk> .
Because it &apos;s porous , all the noise goes away , so the road is quiet .
So , of course , there &apos;s still a lot of comfort , and the vehicle of this street is the <unk> , the <unk> bubble .
What &apos;s a crack ? You can see there on this street <unk> <unk> .
First of all , you get a rock , and then there &apos;s more and more and more and more , and then — — oh , I won &apos;t do that .
But they can <unk> your car window . So you &apos;re not having fun with that .
After all , this broken situation will damage more and more .
Sometimes they form the <unk> .
Oh . He &apos;s ready .
<unk> chicken , of course , can be a problem , but we have solutions .
In fact , you can see here this material is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , as I said , you &apos;ve got a tiny sticky sticky tape between the stones .
In the effect of weather , the Sun radiation , this <unk> material , this sticky glue in between these connections would contract , and if they contract , it would have these extremes of cracks that were <unk> and then <unk> off the blocks .
And if you drive across the road , you &apos;re going to destroy this set of exercise -- as we just saw here .
In order to solve this , we developed <unk> materials .
If we made this <unk> material , then we could find solutions .
So what we can do is we use a piece of <unk> <unk> using steel <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we blend these little little pieces of <unk> with <unk> plastic .
So we have asphalt mixed in very small slices .
Then you need a machine , as you can see here , to cook -- a <unk> .
<unk> sensors are very good .
So what you do is you &apos;re steel heating , you make the plastic <unk> , and the <unk> is going to flow into these little <unk> , and the stones will stick to the top layer .
I &apos;m using a radar oven , because I can &apos;t get a <unk> sensors on a stage .
The waves also has the same action system .
I &apos;ve got a prototype in the oven , and now I &apos;m going to take it out and check it out .
This is the material that &apos;s taken out .
I said we invented a factory like this in the lab to heat up the material .
In the lab we tried a lot of prototypes , and then the government , they really saw <unk> and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s great . We have to check . &quot;
Then they gave us a line of highway , 400 meters of <unk> <unk> , here we had to build a prototype of this new material .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done here . You look at the test test we did , and then , of course , this path will survive for years without harmed . That &apos;s what we learn from experimentation .
We &apos;ve taken samples of samples from this path and we try them in the lab .
So we <unk> the specimens , put a lot of stuff on it , <unk> them with a <unk> sensor , <unk> them and then try it again .
We can do it all over again .
And actually , the conclusion came out of this research , that if we were <unk> the streets of four years with a <unk> -- this is the size of the size that we built it to preserve the way that we can do it , and then we can double the <unk> lifespan of the <unk> , of course saving more money .
Well , to <unk> , I can tell you that we made a kind of material using steel , adding the steel , using the use of the sugar , to actually increase the lifespan of the sugar , which is twice as simple as you can do , as well as you can <unk> your length length , using very simple , <unk> tricks that save more money .
Now you &apos;re wondering whether it works or not .
We also have a prototype here . It &apos;s also quite warm .
It was supposed to be cool down before I showed you the work of <unk> therapy .
But let me try it .
<unk> . Yes , it matches .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a question of questions that answers are <unk> .
The theme was the secret of domestic violence , and the question I asked was the question that people were always asked : Why did she stay ?
Why should the women fight them ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , not a social worker or a professional expert .
I &apos;m just a woman who wants to share my story .
I was 22 years old , and I graduated at Harvard College College .
I moved to New York City when I started writing and editor for <unk> magazine .
For the first time I had my apartment , my American Express card card , and I had a big secret .
The secret is that , this gun was loaded on <unk> <unk> in my head by the man who I thought was a man who was born , over and over again .
The man who loved me was more than everyone gun at the head and threatened to kill me every time I had no longer remembering .
I &apos;m here to tell you about crazy love , a <unk> trap <unk> in the case that millions of women and maybe a number of men every year .
This could be your story .
I don &apos;t like a domestic violence consultant .
I had English <unk> from Harvard College , and business Business Business economics from <unk> Business School .
I had so much career working on companies in the <unk> of America like Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson , Leo <unk> and Washington <unk> .
I married to the second husband who was almost 20 years and had each other .
My dog is the Black <unk> , and I drive the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the first thing I want to talk to you about is a domestic violence that happens to everyone every world , every religion , every level of income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to say is that people think that domestic violence happens to women , that &apos;s women &apos;s issues .
It &apos;s not true .
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men , <unk> , <unk> , in the middle of the family , where the last place we want or expect to see that violence is a cause of violence that is a cause of a family violence .
I told myself , I am the person on Earth who lives with the men who beat me , but actually , I &apos;m a typical stereotype of my age .
I was 22 years old in the United States , and women from 16 to 24 were three times more likely to become a victim of domestic violence compared to women in other ages , and over 500 women and girls who were killed every year by violent lovers , brothers , and husband in the United States .
I used to be a typical victim because I didn &apos;t know anything about the domestic violence , the warning warning of it .
I met <unk> in a month , rains and cold .
He sat beside me in the tunnel of New York City , and he started talking to me .
He told me about two things .
One is him , like me , graduated from <unk> <unk> , and that he worked at a very impressive bank in Wall Street .
But the most dramatic thing to me at the first encounter was that he was intelligent and he looked like a farmer .
He &apos;s got a little bit of a drink in this size , and he has a huge <unk> and <unk> hair like the <unk> and he seems so sweet .
One of the smartest things <unk> did , from the beginning , was to create a hallucination that I was a promising relationship .
He did this in the beginning by <unk> me .
So we started dating , and he loved me in the face that I was smart , that I went to Harvard , that I was <unk> to help new girls and work .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood , my hopes and dreams .
<unk> believe me , like a writer and a woman in a way that no one has ever had .
And he also came up with the incredible atmosphere of trust between us in the same way that he was <unk> and <unk> by his father , and the <unk> was so bad that he left his school at age eight , even though he was so smart and he spent almost 20 years to rebuild their life .
That explains why degrees at <unk> <unk> and his work in Wall and his magnificent future has significant meaning to him .
If you tell me that this man is smart , funny , this <unk> , who <unk> me one day , who is my friend and where I &apos;m on Christmas break , I &apos;m going to laugh at you because there &apos;s no luck of violence or control or anger at <unk> from the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic relationship was lust and seduction .
I didn &apos;t know that the second phase was isolated .
&quot; Hey , you know what , all this <unk> and <unk> are great , but I need to take her out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear her screaming and out of this town where your neighbors can hear her screaming and out of this town where the neighbors can hear her <unk> and family and his colleagues can see the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So instead , <unk> went home on a Friday night , and he said to me that he was going to be so safe and loved that he was not going to have to prove his <unk> , and his <unk> , went to a small town in New England where he could start his life with me , to a small town in New England where he could start his life with me .
Now , the last thing I want to do is I left New York City and my dream , but I thought you have to sacrifice your life , so I agree and <unk> , <unk> and I leave Manhattan .
I didn &apos;t think that I was working on a crazy love , that I was taking the first step into the <unk> , <unk> and precise <unk> set .
The next step in this <unk> scenario is to put into violence threats and see how much her response .
From here , guns .
When we moved to New England -- you know , where <unk> was based on to feel safe -- he bought three <unk> .
He held one tree in the drawer of our car .
A tree beneath the knee of our bed bed , the third plant that he always sits in .
And he said he needed these guns because of the damage he had experienced in the past as a child .
He needs them to be protected .
But these gun are actually a message to me , and even though he hasn &apos;t touched my arm , but my life is in danger every day .
<unk> was attacked in me five days ago .
It was seven o &apos;clock when I was wearing my clothes .
I was <unk> on the <unk> , trying to <unk> my <unk> and I was overwhelmed , and I was using my anger as a cure to take two arms around my neck and so <unk> to my body that I couldn &apos;t breathe or screaming , and he took <unk> <unk> beating my head on the wall .
Five days later , <unk> <unk> on my neck came up well , and I wore my mom &apos;s dress , and married to him .
The things that happened , I &apos;m sure that we would live happily because I loved him , and he loved me too much .
And he was so sorry .
He was really <unk> for weddings and family joining me .
It &apos;s a <unk> , and he &apos;s never going to hurt me anymore .
It happened twice for the last week .
For the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach , and I was lost , and he hit one on my head , so very strongly that I was constantly <unk> into the glass of the car .
A few days later , when he was driving home home after the security week , he was tired of the car , and he threw the food food on my face .
<unk> <unk> hit me twice every week for two months and half a year from my marriage .
I was wrong to think that I was the only case and myself alone .
A third of American women experienced domestic violence or <unk> in some of their lives and the CDC report to see 15 million children being used every year , 15 million .
So I actually stayed in a very good company .
Come back to my question : Why am I staying ?
The answer is very easy .
I don &apos;t know he &apos;s violent me .
And he pointed at my head , which pushed me down to the floor , threatened me down to the floor , threatening to kill my own dog , and I was wearing my <unk> , and I &apos;d never been wearing my interview , I never once thought a wife was executed .
Instead , I &apos;m a strong woman in love with a man who has a problem , and I am the only one on earth can help <unk> faces with his evil .
The other question that people ask , why did she not leave ?
Why did I not walk ? I could walk away at any point .
For me , it &apos;s the sad and <unk> question , because we , the victims that you don &apos;t know : it &apos;s a terrible risk to leave a loser like that .
Because the last step in the classical drama was killing her .
More than 70 percent of domestic violence happen after the victim finishes the relationship , after she left , because then the violence had nothing to lose .
But as a result , after a long run , even after the <unk> of marriage , the same child who are forced to be forced by the judgment of the trial , are often forced by the judgment of the trial , not with the men who beat their mother .
And we kept asking , why don &apos;t she leave ?
I was able to leave , because the last <unk> hit was <unk> away from my <unk> .
I realized that the man I loved would kill me if I left him .
So I broke silence .
I told people : the police , the neighbor , my friends and family , who are totally alien , and I stand here today because you &apos;re all helping me .
We have this idea of victims of victims as the scary ones , <unk> women who destroy themselves .
And the question , &quot; Why did she stay ? &quot;
It &apos;s the argument of some people , &quot; which is her fault when the victim has chosen to love men with the idea of destroying us .
But since the &quot; <unk> Love &quot; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of stories from men and women who have taken away the life of life -- happiness , pleasure -- like employees , wives , <unk> , who live totally without violence , like me .
Because I was a typical agent of domestic violence that ended me as a <unk> survivor of domestic violence .
I got married to a nice and nice man , and we had three children .
I have the <unk> <unk> , and I have the <unk> .
What I never had to do was half , always a <unk> hit in my head because somebody said that he loved me .
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Oh , this is great , &quot; or , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s so silly , &quot; but all this time , I really talked about you .
I &apos;m sure that you in the number of people who are listening to me right now are people who are being abused or people who have been abused by their own .
<unk> can influence your daughter , your girlfriend , your best friend right now .
I could end my crazy love by destroying silence .
I &apos;m beating my silence today .
This is how I helped other victims , and this is my final request .
Let &apos;s talk about what you heard here .
<unk> is scary in silence .
You have power to end the simple force simply by hitting that light .
We need victims to everybody .
We need you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
<unk> the <unk> of the light today by talking about it with your kids , your peers , your friends and family .
<unk> the rest of their lives , but happiness , loving future .
Notice the old news of violence and lies of conscience , reducing it down , just for the victim .
Together we can make our bed bed , our family table and our families become hot and safety .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a particular group of animals .
There are 10,000 species in the world .
<unk> is one of the most serious <unk> of birds .
When you see a <unk> <unk> like this , the first thing that comes out in your mind is , these are <unk> creatures , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to your flesh .
I wanted to change that perception . I wanted to change the feelings that you were spending for these birds , because they needed to come to our compassion . They really needed it .
I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why are they so bad ?
When Charles Darwin crossed the Pacific in <unk> from the train ship , he saw the <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; These birds are disgusting with the very bright head that were created to celebrate <unk> in <unk> .
You can &apos;t get the worse <unk> , and that &apos;s the words of Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed the idea when he came back , let me tell you why .
They &apos;re also connected to <unk> <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , stupid characters .
More recently , if you &apos;re following the news in Kenya — these are the characteristic attributes that bind with the <unk> . But I want to resist that .
I want to protest because you know what ?
Because the military doesn &apos;t keep the environment in clean .
We don &apos;t stop the contagion of disease .
They hardly <unk> a husband .
They were going extinct .
And , what I like most is , the <unk> <unk> look .
There are two <unk> on this planet .
The New World <unk> <unk> found mainly in the United States , like the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> of the World , where there are 16 species , and there are 11 species of these 16 species that are endangered .
So , why is it important ? First , they provide basic ecosystems . They &apos;re cleaning up .
They &apos;re really <unk> .
They cleaned dead bodies to the bone .
They help kill bacteria . They help us attract the charcoal that has been <unk> and causes huge losses for the livestock industry and causing the other species .
<unk> studies have shown that there are areas where there are no <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and the tremendous outcome from this is the spread of disease .
<unk> has also a big history of their importance .
They were combined with ancient Egypt .
<unk> is a symbol of <unk> and its mom , and with a <unk> , they represent the agreement between the <unk> &amp; amp ; The <unk> of Egypt .
In the Hindu spirit , <unk> is the <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> his life to save <unk> <unk> from the Palm devil .
In the <unk> culture , they do it very important . In places like <unk> , there &apos;s nowhere to bury the dead , or there &apos;s no wood to burn them , so the <unk> are providing a natural waste system .
So what &apos;s the <unk> ?
We have eight species of <unk> appeared in Kenya , in which there are six species under risk of extinction .
The reason is they &apos;re poison , they &apos;re poison , because there are events between the wild , the wild world , the community communities are using this poison to allow them to hunt , but instead , the <unk> are victims .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four species of <unk> are registered on the list of <unk> , which means they &apos;re less than 10 or 15 years , because they &apos;re being turned into prey because they have to have been treated with reducing pain as <unk> .
This drug has been banned from the Indian interest in India they &apos;ve proven that they &apos;ve proven .
Because there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> that there &apos;s a surge of the number of local dogs , when you &apos;ve got a wild <unk> , you &apos;ve got an enormous amount of time on the <unk> , which is a huge number of <unk> in India .
Kenya is going to have the largest wind Delta in Africa with the <unk> engine .
I &apos;m not against the wind of the wind , but we need to work with government , because the wind engine makes these birds . They cut them .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
In West Africa has a terrible <unk> mall to serve the ghost and <unk> <unk> .
So what did we do ? We &apos;re doing this research on these birds . We &apos;re doing a signal .
We &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology , where they go .
We can see that they &apos;re moving to lots of different countries , so if you &apos;re focused on problems on the scale of the region , this will not help you .
We need to work with government on the region level .
We &apos;re working with local communities .
We &apos;re talking to them about the <unk> <unk> to honor these beautiful creatures and the benefits that they bring .
How do you help ? You can become an active person , make a voice . You can write your own government and tell them that we need to focus on these <unk> animals . <unk> a little bit of the time to pass . <unk> the message .
When you walk out of this room , you get information about the <unk> , but let &apos;s tell your family , your children , your neighbor .
They &apos;re very graceful . Charles Darwin said he changed the idea because he saw them flying in a sense of force in the sky .
Kenya , this world , is going to be much more poor if there are no great species .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 years old , I remembered one morning I woke up when I listened to my house .
My father was hearing the BBC on the tiny gray radio radio .
He had a very big smile , and it was very unusual because it hurt that it hurt hurt .
He said , &quot; The Taliban went off ! &quot;
Now I didn &apos;t know well , but I could see my father was very , very happy .
&quot; Now I can really go to school . &quot; He said .
One morning I couldn &apos;t forget .
A real school .
You know , the Taliban came in Afghanistan since I was six years old and stopped the girls .
For five years later , I was dressed as a son to walk with my sister to a secret school because my sister had been forbidden from her house .
That &apos;s the only way we can go to school .
Every day , we &apos;ve gone differently to have no one question about our destination .
We hid the book in the <unk> , like everyone would think we &apos;d go shopping .
The school in a house , over 100 of us were <unk> in a small living room .
Quite warm during winter , but summer is extremely hot .
We all know that he was taking his own personal risk , students and parents .
There was a few times , a <unk> school closed for about a week for the unexpected Taliban .
We &apos;ve always asked them what they know about us .
Are we watching ?
Do they know where we are here ?
We were very scared , but nevertheless , we wanted to go to school .
I &apos;m very fortunate to be raised in a family that is very respectful and valuable .
My grandfather was a very <unk> man .
One was entirely <unk> from a long <unk> in Afghanistan , he <unk> to his daughter , my mother came to school , and so his father was giving up .
But my education mother became a teacher .
She &apos;s here .
She retired two years ago to use our house to open school for girls and women in their neighbors .
And this is my father who was the first person in his family .
No doubt that his children will be educated , including his daughter , regardless of the Taliban , regardless of the dangers .
To him , the children are not supposed to be a greater risk .
In the Taliban , I remember that there were moments when I was angry about our lives and that I was always terrified and I couldn &apos;t see the future .
I wanted to give up my point of school , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , I can lose everything you have on this life .
<unk> can be <unk> . You can be forced to leave from the house during the war .
But one thing that &apos;s going to survive forever is something in this , and if we &apos;re forced to sell our blood to pay the extra <unk> , we will .
So what do you want to continue ?
I &apos;m 22 years old today .
I was raised in a country that was ruined by the war of war .
Less than six percent of the young women that I had learned after high school class , and if my family hadn &apos;t committed to my school , I also became one of them .
But I &apos;m proud of standing here as a graduate student .
When I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was left by his family because he would let his daughter go to school , was one of the first people to celebrate me .
He didn &apos;t show off my college , but I was the first woman , and I was the first woman to carry him on the streets in Kabul .
My family believed me .
I wanted to dream , but my family wanted to give me bigger .
So I &apos;m a global Ambassador for <unk> , which is the global campaigning to educate women .
So I made the <unk> , the first school and the only place for girls in Afghanistan , a country that was still dangerous to girls .
I was so excited to see my school with my expectations to embrace this opportunity .
And I saw my parents and fathers like my father , who would support them , regardless and even when I had a lot of opposition opposition .
Like Ahmed . It &apos;s not his true name , and I can &apos;t show his face , Ahmed is my father .
Less than a month , he and his daughter was on their way to <unk> from their village , and they were literally killed by a bomb in a few minutes .
When he was talking about the house , his phone phone , a voice that threatened him if he continued to take his daughter to school , they &apos;ll try it again .
And he said , &quot; If you want to kill me , but I &apos;m not going to destroy my daughter &apos;s future for ideological thinkers and <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m now aware of Afghanistan , and this is what &apos;s often overlooked in the West , which is behind most of us as a parent value to the value of their daughter and who sees their daughters as their own success .
This is not a mother who doesn &apos;t matter in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re the first person and a compelling <unk> to a future of their daughter , but in a social situation like Afghanistan , we need the support of men .
In the Taliban , girls went to school for hundreds of people who remembered , that &apos;s illegal .
But today , over three million girls are in Afghanistan in Afghanistan .
Look very differently from the United States .
I found that Americans see vulnerability , vulnerable in change .
I fear that all of those changes wouldn &apos;t last longer after the U.S. Army pulled away .
But when I came back to Afghanistan , when I saw my students in my school and their parents support them , encouraged them , I saw a promising future and a change that will last long-term .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , <unk> , and every day of <unk> school reminded me of that .
Like I , they have a big wish .
Thank you .
Hello . This is my cellphone phone .
A cell phone can change your life , and a phone gives you free freedom .
With a cell phone , you can film an image of <unk> action in Syria .
With a cell phone , you can also upload a message on <unk> and start joining a protest protest in Egypt .
And also with a phone you can recorded a song , upload it to <unk> and become famous .
All that could be just with your cellphone .
I was a kid of 1984 , and I lived in Berlin City .
Let &apos;s go back to that moment , in this city .
You can see here how thousands of people stand up and <unk> for change .
It was in the fall of 1989 , and imagine the people who stood up and performed that change has a mobile phone in the pockets .
Who in the room has mobile phones ?
Just raise it up .
Please raise your phone , raise your phone up !
Just raise it up . A Android phone , a Blackberry , wow .
A lot . Today , most of us have a mobile phone .
But today I &apos;m going to talk about myself and my phone , and about how it has changed my life .
I &apos;m going to talk about that .
There are <unk> blocks .
<unk> information .
But why is that information here ?
The reason was due to the summer of 2006 , the European Commission proposed a official sight .
It &apos;s called the data record .
This vision just shows every European telecommunications company in Europe , every family provider , all over Europe , has to store huge amounts of information about people who use it .
Who &apos;s the call for whom ? Who &apos;s sent someone emails ?
Who sent the mobile messages ?
And if you use mobile phones , this is where the problem exists .
All this information is stored at least at least six months , until two years by the Internet you &apos;re using or provider .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want to . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want personal information .
We want to get autonomy in digital age , and we don &apos;t want to show that telecommunications companies and providers are storing all of our information .
They &apos;re lawyers , journalists and all <unk> , all say , &quot; We don &apos;t want to . &quot;
And you can see here , like the 10,000 people who march in march on the streets of Berlin and say &quot; Freedom , no fear . &quot;
And some people even say , it &apos;s like 2.0 2.0 .
<unk> is the German police force in Eastern Germany .
I &apos;ve also wondered , did it work ?
Can they record our genomes ?
When we use mobile phones ?
So I asked my Internet to use , <unk> <unk> , who was the largest telecom provider at the time , and I asked them , please , send me my entire genome that they had stored .
I asked them to send me one last time , and I went on to ask , but what I got was a <unk> answer . <unk> blah blah .
But then I said , I want to get this information , because they &apos;re saving my life .
And I decided to send myself to court , because I wanted to have this information .
But <unk> <unk> said , no , we &apos;re not going to give you this information .
And finally , I have a deal with them .
I would destroy the lawsuit , and they would give me the information that I asked .
Because at that point , the federal constitution tribunal decided that the European size of the European Union is not working in the legal constitution .
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CDs inside .
And on a CD , what I need to read up there .
<unk> blocks of information .
I first looked at it , and I said , okay , it &apos;s a big data file . Good big file .
But then I realized , this is my entire life .
This is my last six months , <unk> in this data .
Then I had a pause , what should I do with this ?
Because I can see where I went , where I was sleeping every night , what I did .
But then I said , I want to announce this information .
I want it to be known by the public .
Because I want to show people what the actual data <unk> is .
So for <unk> Online and <unk> Data City , I do the same thing .
These are live pictures of my own six months .
You can zoom out or tidy it , you can either either be back or faster forward .
You can see my walk .
You can even know how I went to <unk> by train to <unk> , and the frequency that I call <unk> between those two places .
It &apos;s all possible with this information .
I had a bit of fear .
But that &apos;s not just about me .
It &apos;s information about all of us .
First of all , it was just like this , I called my wife and she also called me , and we spoke to each other a few times .
And then some friends calling me , they call each other .
And then you call you , and you call you , and you get this massive network network .
But you can see how we communicate with each other , where they call each other , when they go to sleep .
You can see all of that .
You can see the most essential parts , like the leaders in a group .
If you have access to access to these information , you can see the behavior of the community , the society .
If you have access to these information , you can control the whole society .
This is a design drawing for countries like China or Iran .
This is a mapping map to survey society , because you know what someone &apos;s talking to , who &apos;s sent the emails , all if you have access to these information .
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe , until two years .
So as I said to start , imagine if all of these people on the streets of Berlin in summer &apos; 1989 have a mobile phone in his pocket .
Maybe <unk> will know who &apos;s been involved in this talk , and if <unk> knows who &apos;s a leader standing behind it , maybe it &apos;ll never be possible .
The collapse of the Berlin wall would not exist .
And if that , perhaps the collapse of the Iron nets in the Cold War wouldn &apos;t exist .
Because today , functional institutions and companies want to capture information that they have on us as much as possible , the online and the periphery .
They want to be able to track our lives , and because they want to record this information at every time .
<unk> and living in digital age are not conflicting .
What you should do is fight your own autonomy today .
And you have to struggle for it every day .
Then , when you go home , let &apos;s tell my friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century , and it &apos;s not obsolete .
When you go home , talk to your representatives , that by the companies and the function that can capture the specific information , though they don &apos;t necessarily have to .
And if you don &apos;t trust me , let &apos;s ask the Internet to provide the information they &apos;ve stored about .
So , in the future , whenever you use your phone , let &apos;s remind you that you have to struggle for personal autonomy in this digital age .
Thank you .
Photography is my passion since I &apos;m big enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you 15 pictures that I value most , and I don &apos;t get any of them .
There &apos;s no art going on , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , doesn &apos;t even care about light .
In fact , most of them were taken by accidental travel .
The story starts when I went to New York City to participate in a speech , and my wife took a picture I was holding a picture of her baby birthday . We stood in a <unk> track and five .
We came back to New York a year later , so we decided to take a picture .
You can see where the story is .
When I was about to reach my third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you take New York to make a travel travel tour only father and daughter , &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
From then we started with visitors to travel through a photograph .
You know , touch your camera for a completely alien person around the world .
No one has no denial , and fortunately has never been run with our camera .
And we didn &apos;t know how the trip was going to change our lives .
It became totally sacred for us .
This was taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain that yesterday in ways that a five-year-old could understand .
These pictures are not just represent for a moment , or a particular one .
They are the way that we pause for a week of October , thinking about our time and how we change every year , not just in physical terms , but in all sides .
Because even though we took a picture , our daughter changed , my daughter got a new set of discovery , and I had a look at her life through her eyes , how it looked and interacting with everything .
The time that we focus on each other was something we honor and expected for the entire year .
Recently , in a trip , we were walking , my daughter suddenly stopped in the middle of the road , and it pointed to the red <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that it was very interested in our early travels .
She described to me what it sounds like when it was five years old , standing at that location .
It says that it remembers my heart was turning out of a <unk> when he saw her first <unk> for the first time .
And now what it looks like in New York is the universities , because it decided to go to school in New York .
And I realized this : one of the most important things we &apos;ve created is memory .
So I &apos;d like to share the idea of holding a role in making a memory .
I don &apos;t know about you , but in these 15 pictures , I don &apos;t show up very much in my family photographs .
I was always a photograph .
So today I would like to encourage everyone to be in the photo , and don &apos;t you pause next to someone else , and ask , &quot; Are you photographing us ? &quot;
Thank you .
I had never forgotten my grandmothers -- she died in the <unk> : &quot; Hey , fight <unk> . <unk> him .
But don &apos;t ever turn into a form of <unk> . &quot;
Over the past two years , since the <unk> <unk> in Libya launched , <unk> by elite elite waves from <unk> and Egypt <unk> .
I was involved in the workforce and outside of Libya to call the <unk> of <unk> and to start a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s a great revolution .
The young men at the front of the front line demanding the power , raise the <unk> of free , dignity , social justice .
They &apos;ve been clear a mirror of compassion in dealing with the violent dictatorship of <unk> .
They showed an agreement where a <unk> <unk> spread from east to west and stretching to south .
Finally , after six months of war war against the president of 50,000 , we managed to liberate our country and <unk> the <unk> .
However , <unk> left a burden , a legacy of politicians , corruption and <unk> .
For four decades , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> has destroyed infrastructure as well as culture and social foundations .
The perception of destruction and challenges , I just like many other women , <unk> the civil society of Libya , calls the full and transition process to democracy and reconciliation .
Nearly 200 organized institutions in <unk> during that time and immediately after <unk> collapses -- nearly 300 in <unk> .
After the 33 years of rejection , I went back to Libya , with a unique <unk> , I started to organize the training classes , develop the people on leadership .
The New Republic of women , I founded <unk> International Women &apos;s <unk> in the society , from all the different parts of society , to empower the welfare of social empowerment for women and to empower our rights as an equal democracy .
I was in a very difficult situation , <unk> , an environment , an environment that was shaped by political politics and eliminated .
I led the initiative of <unk> International &apos;s <unk> for campaigning for a comprehensive political law , which can bring to all sorts of people , no matter how to come to the vote and vote , and the most important is to settle for the political party to <unk> the male candidates and women in the vertical and horizontally in their list creating a <unk> list .
At the end of the day , our minds were also acknowledged and successful .
Women won <unk> percent of the <unk> House in the back of 4,000 years .
However , a little bit of a little bit of one , the excitement of the elections and of the innovation revolution disappear -- as we wake up with news about violence .
We were waking up with news about the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
On the other time , we woke up with news about the American embassy and attacks in the workforce .
The other day we woke up with news about the military officers .
And every day , every day we woke up with the rules of the civil forces and its social violation on human rights as well as respect to regulations in their laws .
Our society , the formation of the revolution , has become more polarizing and has left away from the ideals , the principles of freedom , the dignity , the social equality that we pursue at the beginning .
<unk> is not content , eliminating and form become symbols of the <unk> .
I &apos;ve come here with no intention of inspired you with the success of the <unk> list and the elections .
And I came here to admit that we -- the whole country made the wrong choice , made decisions wrong .
We didn &apos;t prioritize the public rights .
Because elections don &apos;t bring peace , stability or security for Libya .
Could the list of <unk> and female <unk> between male candidates and women bring peace and reconciliation to the country ?
No , no .
So what did it really help ?
Why do our society continue to be a <unk> society , political by the selfish politics of dominance and eliminating , by both men and females ?
Perhaps it &apos;s not just about the rights of women , but also the feminine values of compassion , tolerance , and comprehensive .
Our society needs a national dialogue , and the greater empathy is needed to be elected elections , which just enhances the distribution and divide .
Our society need some of the women from women more than need numbers and quantity of gender recognition .
We need to stop acting like <unk> <unk> , stop behind <unk> .
We need to start acting like the <unk> of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a national discourse , not only the honor of tolerance , but to practice instead of <unk> , the collaboration instead of competition , instead of <unk> .
These are the ideas that need a country that has been destroyed as almost a country that has been destroyed to be <unk> .
Because of peace as the <unk> , it needs to be <unk> , <unk> between males and females .
That &apos;s the real <unk> .
And we need to establish that vital element before political reality .
According to a poem in &quot; <unk> &quot; -- peace &quot; is from God &apos;s God full of tolerance , <unk> . &quot;
The next , &quot; <unk> &quot; is known in the traditional <unk> &apos; tradition of Arabic , which is &quot; <unk> &quot; -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And because the uterus of the whole fetus is growing in its heart , the divine matrix of the <unk> <unk> that life .
So we &apos;re taught , &quot; Our <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So we &apos;re taught , &quot; Our tolerance won win the <unk> . &quot;
May each of us is <unk> .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I had a bit of a bit like Alice in <unk> .
Penn Penn asked me , a teaching teacher teaching a coach for students .
I was scared .
It was really scared . She was scared of <unk> students , <unk> books and <unk> .
But when the conversations opened , I experienced what Alice was doing as she fell down to the cave cave and discovered the doors to a new world .
It was just what I felt when I was talking to my students . I was amazed by their ideas , and I wanted everyone else to experience this .
I believe the key key to the world is the ability to communicate well .
We don &apos;t all need to communicate with scientists and engineers to change the world .
<unk> and engineering are the people who are dealing with the biggest challenges , from energy to the environment and the health , and there &apos;s a lot , if we don &apos;t know it , and I believe our responsibility , those who are not professionals , is interacting with them .
But <unk> can &apos;t occur if scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us to their own home .
<unk> and engineers , let &apos;s just talk about a <unk> with us .
I &apos;d like to share a few secrets to make sure that we found the science of those who are fascinating , so sexy , very hot .
The first question is : What ?
Why do science relate to us .
Don &apos;t just say that you &apos;re looking at bone research , but let &apos;s say you &apos;re looking at bone tissue , it &apos;s like the grid that <unk> us , because we need to know about <unk> and <unk> .
When you describe science , be careful at using term .
<unk> has prevented us to understand what you are .
Can surely say &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; but why not use &quot; <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
To make an idea is not to lower them .
Instead , as <unk> said : turn things as simple as possible , but don &apos;t get simpler .
Clearly you can talk about the scientific problems without breaking up ideas .
So I &apos;m interested in talking , telling stories , to think about how to engage and make us enjoy what you say .
And when you say , don &apos;t use the first bricks .
Have you ever wondered why we call them the <unk> ?
When you cross them ? <unk> is a <unk> , kill ! And they &apos;re going to kill his lecture .
This is a slide like this , not boring , but <unk> , too much in the context of the brain , causing us <unk> .
Instead , this slide slide of <unk> Brown actually understood the more , which shows the special structure of the bone so far that it really inspired the original design of the <unk> Tower .
And the trick is to use these simple and easy sentences that can depend on that if they don &apos;t go along , and then we use visual images to help us understand more profound things .
I think it &apos;s just a few secrets that help us open that doors and see the <unk> of science and technology .
The engineers I work with teaching me <unk> <unk> things , so I want to summarize with a equation .
Take the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; for &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; that you spend for what you &apos;re doing , then it will be a wonderful interaction .
And so , by the way , the scientists and engineers , when you &apos;re going to solve these equations , by every cost , let &apos;s talk about just eight to me .
Thank you very much .
Hi . I &apos;m Cameron Russell , and for short short time , I &apos;m a model .
Actually , in 10 years .
And I felt that there was a <unk> pressure in the room right now because I should not wear this .
Luckily I had a different suit .
This is the first time somebody &apos;s on the TED stage , so I think you &apos;re very lucky to see this scene .
If a couple of women feel scared when I show up , you don &apos;t have to tell me right now , but then I &apos;ll learn it .
I realized that I was lucky to change what you thought of me in 10 seconds .
Not everybody has the opportunity to do this .
The high heels are really uncomfortable , I don &apos;t define them .
The worst part is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , because every one of you laughed at me , so don &apos;t do anything when it &apos;s on my head .
All right .
Why do I do that ?
It &apos;s amazing .
Actually , hopefully it wasn &apos;t so much as this picture .
<unk> is very powerful , but it &apos;s also very fake .
I just changed exactly what you thought about me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I actually haven &apos;t got any boys in real life .
I felt uncomfortable at that point , and my photographer told me to <unk> <unk> back and put his hand on his hair .
And of course , for having surgery , or the <unk> <unk> that I have two days ago to take pictures , there are very few things that we can do to change our appearance , and our appearance , even though it makes and <unk> , it has a huge effect on our lives .
So today , for me , there &apos;s no fear of being true .
And I stood on this stage because I &apos;m a model .
I stand on this stage because I &apos;m beautiful , a white woman , and within the model , we call it a charming girl .
And I &apos;m going to answer questions that people still ask me , but with real honesty .
So the first question is , how do I become a model ?
And I always say , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m detected , but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
I actually became a model because I won the genetic lottery , and I was a <unk> property , and maybe you were wondering what a product product was .
In the past decades , we have defined beauty not only about health and young children and the balance that we &apos;re given on biological biology to <unk> , which is the height , the <unk> and the females , and the white .
This is the legacy that was built for me , and that &apos;s the legacy I made money on it .
I know that there are some of you who are suspicious here , and there may be some <unk> models like , &quot; Wait . Naomi <unk> . Joan <unk> . &quot;
I want to praise the ignorance of your models . Very impressive .
But unfortunately I have to let you know in 2007 , a Ph.D. graduate student at the University of New York , that &apos;s all the people on the floor , and in <unk> models that are employed only 27 people , less than four percent , is not white .
The next question that people always ask me was : &quot; Can you become a model when you grow up ? &quot;
And my first answer was : &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot;
But the next answer that I really want to say to those girls is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
You know what ? You can become somebody .
You can become president of the United States , or the person who invented a next Internet , or a poet who has a <unk> heart surgeon , which is great , because you &apos;re the first person to do that . &quot;
If , after an interesting list , they say , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; then I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Make your boss . &quot;
Because you don &apos;t have any power , you can probably be the editor of <unk> in the United States or the President of H &amp; amp ; M , or Steven <unk> <unk> .
Tell me that you want to be a model when you grow up like you want to win a lottery ticket when you &apos;re growing up .
It &apos;s beyond its control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career .
I &apos;m going to prove to you -- with 10 years of my experience , when I was a model , because it wasn &apos;t like the heart surgeon , just a short time .
If the photographer is standing here in the light , it &apos;s like a beautiful user interface , and then you &apos;re just going to go forward , and then you go back to the back , you just do it , and then you go back to the back , imagine that your friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Like this .
I hope it &apos;s less <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what happens while again .
Now , sadly after you &apos;re finishing , you write <unk> and you &apos;ve done some things , because if you say you want to be president of the United States , but your <unk> says , &quot; The <unk> : 10 years &apos; , people will look at you with a strange eye .
The next question that people always ask me was , &quot; Are all the images correct ? &quot;
That &apos;s right , almost all the images are edited , but it &apos;s a little element of what &apos;s going on .
This is one of the first images that I ever took , which was the first time I took a shower , and I didn &apos;t even have a <unk> .
I know that we &apos;re going into personal stories , but I am a little girl .
This is my appearance , photographed her grandmother before a few months .
This is me in the same day when I photographed it .
My friend has been with me .
This is me at dinner a few days before shooting for <unk> France .
This is me with soccer teams in <unk> magazine .
So here I am .
I hope you see -- these images are not pictures .
It &apos;s the images that are made up , and it &apos;s built by a group of specialists , <unk> , <unk> , photographer and all of their <unk> , <unk> their production , and they create this . That &apos;s not me .
The next question I was asked was , &quot; What are you for for free ? &quot;
I have a lot of <unk> shoes that I &apos;ve never been carrying , which is exceptions , but the free things that I &apos;ve learned are things that I have in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and the other time , I was going to the store , and I forgot to give the money , and they gave me free .
When I was a teenager , I sat in a <unk> who was a very frightening driver , and she went down the red light , and all I did was to say , &quot; Excuse the police , &quot; and we were able to go .
I have the free stuff that &apos;s because of my appearance , not because I &apos;m somebody and there are people who are willing to spend more money for their appearance rather than they are .
I lived in New York City , and last year , in 140 millennia of <unk> and <unk> , 86 percent were <unk> and <unk> , largely teenagers .
In New York City , there are only <unk> thousand black people and <unk> , so for them , the question is not , &quot; Am I arrested ? &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; How many times do I get caught ? &quot;
When I was preparing for this talk , I found that 53 percent of the 13 girls in America didn &apos;t like their body , and this number was to 78 percent when they were 17 .
The last question that people ask me is , &quot; What does it feel like to be a model ? &quot;
I think what they want to hear is &quot; If you were a bit thinner , and your hair <unk> , you &apos;d be happy and happy . &quot;
And when we were behind the chicken , we gave the answer to something like this .
&quot; It &apos;s great to travel , and work with creative and inspiring people . &quot;
And these are facts , but that &apos;s only half , because what we never said before lens lens , which I never would say before lens lens , was , &quot; I am insecure . &quot;
I was safe because I had to think about my image every day .
And you have ever wondered yourself , &quot; If your more <unk> and your hair <unk> , would I be happier ? &quot;
You just have to meet a group of people , because they have the most <unk> , <unk> hair and <unk> , and they may be the most insecure women on the planet .
When I was writing this talk , I felt very hard to find out , &quot; I get all this stuff , because I &apos;ve been lucky enough , &quot; and I feel that it &apos;s really uncomfortable to <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s really uncomfortable to follow the sentence , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t make me happy . &quot;
But mostly it &apos;s hard to remove a heritage of sex and ethnic problems while I &apos;m one of the biggest benefits .
But I &apos;m also happy and honored to come up and I &apos;ve been working with a lot of companies in my career , because I &apos;m probably not going to talk about how I got the first job , or maybe I &apos;m not going to talk about how I have the first job , or maybe I &apos;m not going to talk about how I got the money to pay the money , which seems like this right now .
If there &apos;s anything <unk> in this talk , I hope it &apos;s all that we feel more comfortable when we recognize the power of the image of our own success and our failure .
Thank you .
There are many ways that the people around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t touch each other around , so there &apos;s a lot of wisdom that &apos;s never known , even though we share public spaces .
So a few years ago , I was trying to have a lot of ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paper , <unk> and chalk .
And these projects came from questions I asked , like , how much money do I have to pay for their apartments ?
How do we borrow and borrow a lot more stuff without typing each other at a bad time ?
How do we share more than our memories of buildings of abandoned buildings , and understand better about our landscape ?
And how do we share more than our hopes to cash stores , so our communities can reflect our need and dream today ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I &apos;m in love with New Orleans .
My spirit is always <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I believe in the city that always make place for music .
I feel like every time someone <unk> it , New Orleans has a march .
Cities has some of the most beautiful structures in the world , but it also has a number of biggest value in the U.S.
I live close to this house , and I think I can make it become more beautiful for my community , and I think something that can change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost one person I loved loved .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was unexpected and <unk> .
And I thought about death so much , and this makes me feel deep for the time that I &apos;ve had , and that makes sense for my life now .
But I struggled to keep this perspective in my everyday life .
I felt like it was very easy to capture the day , and forget what really meant to you .
So with the help of the old friends and the new , I moved one side of this abandoned building into a giant and <unk> piece of pollen : &quot; Before I die , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; to be able to pick up a piece of pollen , reflect their lives , and share their personal aspiration in public space .
I don &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but in the next day , the wall was completely sealed , and it kept continued .
And I want to share something about what people write on that wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to try to steal . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be <unk> on the International <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I &apos;d like to sing for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to grow a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live beyond my <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to give her a hug again . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be somebody &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I &apos;d rather be myself . &quot;
So this space <unk> has become an architectural space , and the hope and dreams of people make me smile , falling tears , and they comfort me throughout my difficulties .
It &apos;s about knowing that you &apos;re not just alone .
It &apos;s about understanding the people around us in new ways and light .
It &apos;s about creating space for reflecting and behold , and remember what really means most to us when we grow up and change .
I did this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from people who wanted to make a wall in their community , so <unk> <unk> , and now the walls were being done in countries in the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , <unk> and even more .
Together , we &apos;ve shown that our public spaces can be possible if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
The two important things we have is time and relations with others .
In the age of increasing our distribution , it &apos;s more important than ever to figure out how to maintain and remember that life is short and soft .
The death is something we &apos;re often not encouraged to talk or even think about , but I &apos;ve already realized that preparing for death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Think about the dead of your life .
Our shared spaces are better than reflected to what happens to us as individuals and as a community , and for more ways to share hope , fear and narratives , people around us can &apos;t only do better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I did an app approach , and this is a very unusual issue for anyone who worked for the app , which is that we &apos;re like managers .
Nobody knows what the hell we did .
So today I &apos;m going to try and explain to you what I do .
Well , dance is one of the activities that people do .
We love <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> takes a special level of expertise and advanced and advanced processes , and maybe the relevant level of the subject involves the genetic factor .
Sadly , the neurological disorder , as Parkinson &apos;s disease , seems to <unk> this particular possibility , which is what happens to my friend <unk> <unk> , who once , was a <unk> artist .
Over the last few years there was tremendous progress in the treatment .
However , <unk> million people have <unk> , and they have to live in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
We need to measure progress in our own way , and ultimately , the only way we know when we really have a treatment , is that we have a proper approach to answer that .
But <unk> with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other <unk> disorders , they don &apos;t have a lot of biology , so there &apos;s no simple blood test method that you can do , and the best that we have is this mental test .
You need to go to hospitals to do that . It &apos;s very expensive , which means that this is out of clinical trials , it &apos;s never done .
But what if the patient could do this test at home ?
That would actually take a trip to the clinic , and if the patient could do it again , what ?
It &apos;s not cost time of staff .
It &apos;s just about 300 dollars , so , to test this test at the <unk> Medical Medical clinic .
So what I &apos;d like to propose to you is a traditional way that we can achieve this , because as you can see , at least in a particular direction , we &apos;re all masters like <unk> <unk> .
Here we have a video of every video that &apos;s vibrating .
It &apos;s active and someone is saying , and we can see ourselves as <unk> <unk> , because we have to incorporate all of the sound agencies when we make the sound , and we all have genes to charge that . For example , <unk> .
It &apos;s like three <unk> <unk> .
I mean , how long did it take a child to say .
From the sound , we can actually stick where the chain of the voice is when the ringing , when the details are affected by Parkinson &apos;s .
So on the lower graph , you can see an example of the <unk> of the sound chain .
We see all the symptoms .
We see the <unk> , debilitating and <unk> .
So speech became more depressed and more accents after a while , and that &apos;s one of the symptoms of it .
Now , these sound effects may actually be more difficult to detect , in some cases , but with any digital <unk> , and using the software analysis that we can determine where someone lies in the middle system between health and disease just by using voice signals .
So how do these trials based on this voice comparing the equivalent of clinical trials ? They both <unk> each other .
The experience of neuroscience doesn &apos;t <unk> . They &apos;re using existing infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design an entirely new hospital to run this experiment .
And they &apos;re both standardized . But one thing , testing is based on <unk> voices .
That means that it can happen .
It &apos;s about 30 seconds as fast .
<unk> cost , and we all know what &apos;s going to happen .
When something becomes extremely cheap , it will be popular .
So here are some wonderful things that I think we can do now .
We can reduce the challenges of the patient .
No need to go to the clinic to examine the test .
We can do observations with high frequencies to get data data .
We can do the recruitment <unk> with low cost to perform clinical trials , the judges on scale is possible for the first time .
We have the chance to start looking for the initial <unk> of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
So in order to do the first steps towards this , we &apos;re going to show the program of Parkinson &apos;s voice .
With <unk> and <unk> , we aim to recording a voice with a very large number worldwide to gather all the data and start taking four targets .
We have local inhabitants that can reach three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone who &apos;s healthy or expensive can call up the price price , and leave the record , a few cents a time , and I &apos;m really pleased to announce that we &apos;ve got six percent of the spend goals in eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom <unk> : So Max , by taking all the forms to 10,000 people , can you tell who &apos;s healthy and who doesn &apos;t ?
What would you conclude with these samples ?
Max : Yeah . Yes . What &apos;s going to happen is , you have to know if you &apos;ve got sick or <unk> .
You see , some people can &apos;t do that . They can &apos;t call it .
But we &apos;re going to take a huge amount of data samples from all of these different cases , and the results are in the case , but then we &apos;re looking at the <unk> factors , and we seek the actual signals of this disease .
So right now , about 86 percent ?
More than that .
In fact , my students <unk> , I had to praise him , because he did some amazing work , he proved that this could be done through mobile phones , which allowed this project to be implemented , and the accuracy is actually coming to 99 percent .
<unk> <unk> . Yeah , a <unk> .
So , what that means is that people will be able to -- people can call up from their cell phone and do this test , and the people with Parkinson &apos;s , and then the doctors can test their progress , they see their health status when they &apos;re pregnant .
Exactly .
Thank you very much . <unk> Max Max .
Thank you very much , Tom .
I live in the <unk> .
This is the south : store stores , fast food , dirt .
So planners come together and they &apos;re shaping the Southern names , and they &apos;re going to replace the South <unk> so that it means different , so they &apos;re going to solve real problems that are actually going on in the city .
This is the south Los Angeles .
<unk> stores , food food , dirt .
Just like <unk> million Americans , I live in a <unk> desert desert area in Central Los Angeles , the home of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that food foods are killing more and more people than they do it .
In southern Los Angeles Los Angeles , people were dying of preventable diseases .
For example , obesity rate in my region five times higher than the <unk> Hills , for example , is about 16 kilometers away .
I got bored when I saw this happen .
And I wondered , how do you feel when there is no good food for your health , when every time you leave the door , you have to see the negative effects that the food system does for where they live ?
I saw the wheelchair buying like the same car .
I see the blood blood centers rises as much as Starbucks .
And I realized that was to stop .
I realize the problem is solutions .
The food is the problem and the food is also the solution .
I was tired of having to drive a 45 minutes , just to buy an apple that didn &apos;t infection .
What I did was to grow a food forest at home .
It &apos;s on a land that we call a walk .
This is <unk> , <unk> long .
The problem is , that land belongs to the city .
But you have to look at it .
So I thought , &quot; Great . I can do what I want , because that &apos;s my responsibility and I have to keep it . &quot;
And this is how I looked at that land .
I was with my team , the <unk> soil , we got together and started planting food forests : fruit plants , you know , nine fruits of vegetables .
We &apos;re a group of <unk> sharing , which are <unk> from many of their lives , from all places in the city , and they &apos;re all free , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it &apos;s beautiful .
Then there was <unk> .
The next city came to me , and the concept was to give me a writer , asked me to break the garden . The same culture became the <unk> of the court .
And I was like , &quot; Come on ? Really ? &quot;
A <unk> for planting trees on a land where people don &apos;t bother ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Okay . Let &apos;s take it here . &quot;
Because this time is nowhere .
And then the New York Times got the news , Steve <unk> writes a paper about it , and talked to the <unk> Conference and one of the <unk> of the green soil sent a <unk> <unk> and with 900 characters , we succeeded .
We had a victory in hand .
That council commissioner is even called , and they say they agree and like what we &apos;re doing .
I mean , come on , why not ?
L.A. led the United States of the wilderness area in the city itself .
They have 42 <unk> of <unk> .
That &apos;s the equivalent of 20 times the <unk> park .
It &apos;s enough to grow <unk> million <unk> .
How can they disagree ?
<unk> a tree gives you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
When the green price costs you a dollar , it &apos;s equal to 75 dollars .
That was my faith , when I told people , let &apos;s grow your food .
<unk> food is like <unk> .
I have heritage in the south .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refused to make a part of what was made to be made for me by some other people , and I was creating my own reality .
I am an artist .
Being a garden is my art . I grew up with my work .
Just like a painter , a <unk> for walls , I <unk> for the walls , the aisle .
I used the piece of the garden , the soil planted like a canvas , and the plant and the trees was exactly what I bought for that fabric .
You will be surprised to what land can do if you turn them into canvas .
You can &apos;t imagine how great the piano is and how they affect people .
So what happened ?
I watched my own piece became an education tool , a tool for the transformation of my life .
To change the community , you have to change the part of the soil .
We are the soil .
You will be surprised to see how kids are affected .
Being a garden is the most effective and challenging job that you can do , especially in the city .
In fact , you get <unk> .
I remember once , there was a mother and daughter coming , and it was about 10 : 30 nights and they were in my own garden and I went outside and they were very ashamed .
I thought , oh my goodness , I feel bad because they &apos;re there and I tell them , they don &apos;t need to do that .
The garden is in the line there is its reason .
I feel embarrassed to see someone who &apos;s closer to me that still has been hungry . And it &apos;s more <unk> , and it &apos;s more enhanced to do this . People say , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re not afraid that people are going to steal your food ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Of course not , I &apos;m not afraid they &apos;ll steal .
So they &apos;re on the street .
All the ideas are .
I want them to take them , but at the same time , I want them to get my health back . &quot;
There was a different one when I worked in a favela in downtown Los Angeles .
There are a lot of men , and they help me out of trucks .
The air was very happy , and they shared the stories of the garden that affected them and they used to grow their vegetables with their mother , and it was amazing to see that this idea was changing them , even for a minute .
So the green soil grew about 20 parts of the garden .
We had about 50 people to <unk> , and they were all voluntary .
If they grow <unk> , they &apos;ll eat <unk> .
If they grow tomatoes , they eat them .
But if none of them show it , if they &apos;re not seen the effects of food to their minds and their bodies , they &apos;re blind to eat anything in front of us .
I &apos;m seeing young people who want to work , but they &apos;re obsessed with something -- I see these colorful kids , and they just follow the path , which no lead .
As a garden , I saw a chance that we could guide the kids to spread their communities , and there was a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we &apos;ll produce George Washington <unk> .
But if we don &apos;t change the land , we &apos;ll never do it .
This is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I wanted to grow a garden where people could share food .
I wanted to take away the shipping lines and convert them into coffee .
Don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about free things , because free is unsustainable .
What &apos;s interesting about sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
I &apos;m talking about trying to work for people , and to pull them out of the street , and give them a sense of joy , pride and joy to grow their own food , open farmers to farmers .
What I want to do here , we &apos;ll make it sexy .
I want all of us to become <unk> , <unk> .
We &apos;ll change the concept of <unk> .
If you &apos;re not a garden , you &apos;re not a <unk> .
Working up with your <unk> , OK ?
And let &apos;s make it a weapon of weapons .
Basically , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to meet me , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit on <unk> chairs and join the meeting where you &apos;re talking about doing this , and then you &apos;re talking about doing this .
If you want to meet me , go out to the garden with your <unk> , and we &apos;ll grow something .
Hi . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya at the southern National Park .
Behind me is the cow of my father , and the back of the cow , the National Park .
The National Nairobi park is not constrained in the area in the south area , which means that wild animals like the horse <unk> out of park .
And so animals like lions follow them , and this is what those lions do .
They kill our animals .
This is one of the cows who were killed at night , and when I got up in the morning , I found it dead , and I felt very sad , because it was the only bull that we had .
My community , the <unk> , believes that we come from heaven with all of our animals and all its land to keep them , which is why we &apos;re so valuable to them .
So I grew up with <unk> .
The fighters <unk> our community and cattle , were very concerned about this .
So they killed lions .
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is the reason that lions in the National National Park are very low .
And every son from six to nine years old , in my community , is responsible to keep my father &apos;s cows , and I have to do the same .
So I had to figure out how to fix this problem .
The first idea that I had was a fire , because I think of rocket lions .
But then I realized that fire doesn &apos;t really work , because it even helped lions see <unk> .
But I didn &apos;t give up . I kept thinking .
And my second idea is to use a <unk> .
I tried to fool those lions &#91; into a thought &#93; I was standing near <unk> .
He was smart .
They go to the first day and see the <unk> , and then they go back , but the second day , they come and say that this is not moving , it &apos;s always there .
And then lions jumped in and kill animals .
So one night , I picked a torch around the <unk> , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
I discovered that lion lions move .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a kid , I used to work in my room all day , and I even opened my mom &apos;s new radio , that day she was almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took an old car <unk> car , and it was a <unk> device that was found in a motorcycle , and it allowed the driver to do it when they wanted to turn the left or right . It flashes .
And I get a switch to switch off and turn the lights off .
And it &apos;s a little light from a flashlight .
And I put things .
As you can see , the solar panel used to <unk> <unk> , and <unk> power to the clock box , I call it the machine .
And the clock box takes the lights off .
As you can see , the light bulb are out there , because it &apos;s the <unk> .
And that &apos;s how light lights on lions when they come at night .
The lights flash and spoofer the lion to make it think that I was going around the <unk> , but I was actually sleeping in my bed .
Thank you .
I installed it in my home two years ago , since then , we had no problem with lions .
The neighbors have heard about this idea .
One of them was this woman .
She had a lot of cattle killed , and she asked me if I could help her build the electric balls .
I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
So I installed the lights . You can see behind , they &apos;re lions bulbs .
So far , I &apos;ve been able to install seven families in their community , and they work .
Now my idea has been used throughout Kenya to <unk> other animals like hyena hyenas , and it &apos;s also used to threaten the elephant from the farmer .
And by this invention , I &apos;ve been lucky to get scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , the International <unk> , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school is now beginning to help and raise awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we installed the lights for families who didn &apos;t reach it and I taught them how to install them .
A year ago , I was just a boy in a <unk> <unk> for my father , I used to see flying flying airplanes , and I told myself one day , I would be sitting inside of it .
And I &apos;m here today .
I had the opportunity to come here with the first time to come to TED .
My biggest dream is to become an aircraft engineer and a pilot .
I had <unk> lions , but now , because my invention is going on the cow and lions , we can live with lions without any conflict .
<unk> <unk> . My language , it means thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know if I hear my story .
So he had this scholarship . Yes .
I &apos;m doing something about it .
<unk> on your list ?
His next invention , you want to make a wire fence . <unk> ?
You know , the fence fence was invented , but she wanted to do their own .
You tried , yes , and you ... I &apos;ve tried it a little bit ago , but I &apos;ve stopped it .
Richard <unk> , she &apos;s very different .
We &apos;re going to allow him to leave him on their way , you know .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I do , and what I do is my <unk> <unk> life , which is shaped for seven years working in Africa .
From <unk> to <unk> , I &apos;m so young , not — — I &apos;ve been working in Zambia , Kenya , <unk> Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in the projects of engineering with African countries .
I worked for the U.S. NGO of Italy and each project we created in Africa .
I was <unk> .
It &apos;s 21 years old , I think , the Italian is good , and we &apos;re working well in Africa .
But instead , we killed everything we had to hit .
So the first project , which inspired my first book , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; is a project in which the Italian decides to teach the true food .
So we &apos;re in Zambia with the seeds of Italy in the Italy of Italy , a nice valley to <unk> , and we teach indigenous <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , people aren &apos;t interested in doing this , so we paid them , and sometimes they come to work .
We were really surprised about the locals , in the <unk> Valley like this one .
But instead of asking why they didn &apos;t grow anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s just time to rescue people from hunger . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa is going well .
We have great tomato <unk> . In Italy , a tomato <unk> is about this size . In Zambia , it &apos;s big .
It &apos;s incredible , and we &apos;re telling the <unk> , &quot; Everybody has this <unk> <unk> . &quot;
When the tomato ones start to go , nine , and there are red , only by one night , about 200 galaxies from the river to go up and clean up all .
We said to the <unk> , &quot; My God , the <unk> ! &quot;
And the people said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t grow anything here . &quot;
&quot; So why don &apos;t everyone tell us before ? &quot;
I thought it was <unk> in Africa , but then when I look at what the Americans are doing , the Brits are doing , and after seeing what they do , I feel a little bit proud of my project in Zambia .
Because , you know , only at least we feed the <unk> .
You should look at something <unk> , you should look at the nonsense that we &apos;ve given for people who are not surprisingly unexpected .
You want to read a book , read &quot; The <unk> Aid , &quot; &quot; written by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> economist .
The book was invented in 2009 .
We , the Western aid institutions have brought to Africa 2 billion Kim in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you what that money did .
Go read her book .
Reading it from an African woman , the damage we did .
<unk> like us are <unk> , <unk> , and we only have two ways to treat other people : or defend , or protection .
Two words from &quot; La &quot; <unk> , &quot; means &quot; as fathers . &quot;
They make two different meanings .
<unk> , I treat anyone from another culture like they were my child . &quot; I love them . &quot;
<unk> , I treat everybody from another culture like my <unk> .
That &apos;s why the white man in Africa is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; he &apos;s .
I was in the face of reading the book , &quot; <unk> , but beautiful , &quot; writing by <unk> , said , above all , in economic growth , if others don &apos;t need help , let &apos;s leave them .
This is supposed to be the first commandment of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the organizers of this meeting , puts a stick into the floor , and says , &quot; Are we <unk> about a city without new <unk> ? &quot;
When I was 27 years old , I decided that I had a system called <unk> <unk> , where you &apos;re not going to start anything you can never motivate , but become a full man for the local aspirations , the people who are people who have dreams want to become a better human being .
So you <unk> your mouth .
Never bring a community with ideas , you sit with the locals .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We met people with coffee . <unk> wine .
We had no infrastructure .
And what we &apos;re going to do is become friends of each other , and find what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is hope .
You can give someone an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , then what do you do ?
The aspiration of women for the rise of self is the most important .
<unk> desire for the rise of individual is the most important thing .
And we helped them explore the knowledge , because nobody in the world could succeed alone .
People who have an idea that may not have understood , but the understanding is present .
So many years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , just one , instead of , to a community , and tell people what they should do , why don &apos;t we listen to them even one time ? Not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There &apos;s a problem in community meetings meetings .
The entrepreneurs never arrived , and they didn &apos;t have any life to tell you , in the community meeting , what they wanted to do with their money , the opportunity they found .
So this is a blind spot .
The most popular people in the community , you never know , they don &apos;t come to public meetings meetings .
What we do is we &apos;ve got to work <unk> and to do that , you have to create a viable structure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new story .
A new discipline like a family doctor for entrepreneurs , who sits with you in your house , at the coffee table , and lets you find resources to make your appetite into a lifestyle .
I started as an experiment in <unk> , Western Australia .
I was in a Ph.D. of course at the time , trying to get away from the New <unk> equation that was to come and tell you what to do .
So what I did in my first year at <unk> was just an encyclopedia on the road , and in three days , I had the first client who was <unk> in the garage , and the organization was <unk> , and then a fisherman came up to me and said , &quot; Who are you helping ? Can you help me ? Can you help me ? &quot;
And I &apos;m going to help these fish <unk> who know how to work together and sell these kinds of tuna that are not for the $ cost of 15 dollars a sign , and then the farmers are coming up , saying , &quot; Hey , did you help the guy , could you help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 consecutive projects and the government to find me , &quot; What do you do ?
How do you do that ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I did something very hard .
I was <unk> and I listened to them . &quot;
So the government told me , &quot; Go ahead . &quot;
We did it in 300 communities all over the world .
We helped the 40,000 jobs of jobs .
There &apos;s a new generation of people who are exhausted for isolation .
<unk> Peter <unk> , one of the greatest management of governance in history , over time 96 , a few years ago .
<unk> <unk> is a philosophical professor to work in business , and this is what Peter <unk> says : &quot; <unk> is really not compatible with a society and a business economy . &quot;
<unk> is a fatal marriage for entrepreneurs .
So right now you &apos;re rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the smartest people in <unk> want to do with their own hands .
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you .
You have to give them security , privacy , you have to really be inspired by helping them , and they &apos;re going , according to the mob .
With a <unk> community , we can have about 200 customers .
Can you imagine a <unk> community , intelligent intelligence , aspirations ?
How do you clap in this morning ?
<unk> , people who aspire . They are friends .
So what I &apos;m talking about is the business <unk> is where it exists .
We &apos;re at the end of the <unk> Industrial Revolution with <unk> materials ; the production that is unable to replicate , and <unk> , we have these unsustainable systems .
The internal combustion engine in sustainability .
The <unk> Railway is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is how to nurture , fix , education , mobility and communication to seven billion people in sustainability .
There &apos;s no technology to do that .
How would the invention of the green revolution ? <unk> ? Forget !
<unk> ? Forget !
That would be the identities , and they &apos;re doing it right now .
There &apos;s a funny story that I &apos;ve read on a <unk> magazine years ago .
There &apos;s a group of experts invited to discuss the future of New York City in <unk> .
And in <unk> , the group group group came together , and interviewed what was happening to New York City over the next 100 years , and the <unk> conclusion was the following : New York City will no longer survive for 100 years .
Why ? Because they look at the curve on the charts , and they say , if the population continues to scale , to move a population of New York City , they &apos;re going to need six million horses , and that waste from six million horses is there .
They will get <unk> in the <unk> .
So in <unk> , they saw this <unk> <unk> technology which made the life in New York City City .
So what happened ? In the next 40 years , at the time of 1900 , in the U.S. , there were <unk> companies .
The idea of looking for a new technology has completely gone beyond all , and there are very little factories in the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to give them security .
No , they won &apos;t get to talk to you .
And then you have to bring them a great service , separate and <unk> service .
And then you have to talk to them about business .
The smallest company , the largest company , has to be able to do three wonderful things after : The product that you want to sell is the most efficient , you have to have a huge marketing strategy , and you have to have a public finances .
Think about this ?
We &apos;ve never met a single individual in the world who &apos;s just done , selling it and managing money at the same time .
That doesn &apos;t exist .
This animal has never been born .
We did a study , and we looked at 100 companies in the Carnegie world , <unk> , <unk> , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There &apos;s only one thing that all companies work in all around the world have , just one thing : No company starts with one person .
Now we teach the <unk> of the ages of the ages of Richard <unk> , and we started the classroom by giving them the first two <unk> of Richard <unk> &apos;s biography , and how many times Richard <unk> used to use the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he used the word &quot; Me &quot; .
Never ever come from &quot; I , &quot; and &quot; we &quot; 32 times . &quot;
He didn &apos;t start alone .
<unk> who started a company . Nobody .
So we &apos;re able to create a community where there are people who are supporting the basis of the basic business model sitting in the coffee cafe , the pub , and your friends who are going to make you the kind of thing that someone who &apos;s trying to make people talk about this hero , &quot; What do you need ? &quot;
What can you do ?
You can sell it , you can sell it ? You can manage money ?
&quot; Oh , no , I can &apos;t do this . &quot; Do you want me to find somebody else for you ? &quot;
We activate communities .
We have volunteers that help help <unk> <unk> , they help help find the resources and humans , and we discover that the magic of this community is just by holding the desire and the economy of this community by holding the desire , the energy and the imagination of your mind .
Thank you .
By March , 2011 , I made a <unk> <unk> in New York City .
We are <unk> creatures .
It &apos;s hidden in the dark room , and generally avoiding sunlight .
We give the cleaner to thinner , the better it is , the more beautiful the skin , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the press , but we also have talented artists with many years of experience and <unk> .
In November 2011 , watching the world of the world at home , I saw tragic events happening in Japan .
Then , the volunteer organization I joined in <unk> <unk> <unk> , in a few days , went to the field of the response .
I , along with hundreds of volunteers who understand that couldn &apos;t just sit alone , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13 , I found my way to the <unk> town .
It &apos;s a little <unk> village in <unk> , with about 50,000 people , one of the first places that are affected by the tsunami .
The water level here is recorded over 24 meters , and three miles deep into the land .
<unk> , the town was devastated .
We pulled the fragments from the channel , the basement .
cleaning up the school , toilet toilets , <unk> for innovation and rehabilitation .
We cleaned tons of tons of fish and <unk> from the local <unk> plant .
We <unk> <unk> , but who was happy .
For many weeks , volunteers and people are looking for one thing .
They were looking for photos and photographs and <unk> and cards .
That &apos;s all done .
They &apos;ve collected and desks them to stay in places around the markets .
Not at that point that I realized that these pictures were actually a huge amount of personal contribution in these people .
When you run the waves , to save the Internet , they &apos;ve left everything , everything is left behind .
At the end of the week there , I went to help a moving center in town .
I helped tidy the hot spring hot water , a giant shower .
This is where the <unk> has gathered pictures .
This is where people talk about it , and that day I &apos;ve got an honor , because they trust me to help them clean the photos .
<unk> and excitement . Before that , I heard I had to think <unk> out of the framework , but only when I really experienced that new thing happened .
So when I look through pictures , there &apos;s a number of photographs that have been in the envelope , and some of them are still in the envelope , and I think , as a figure figure , I can <unk> my spine and my <unk> , and I know , hundreds of other people can do that .
So I went on to Facebook and ask a few people , and to the morning , I got a lot of positive feedback , I knew I had to start working .
We started to edit these images .
This is the first one .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but <unk> is <unk> the face of her face , has to be <unk> with <unk> and <unk> .
If not , the girl is not going to look like me , and certainly it &apos;s as bad as the picture of a broken picture .
Now over time , very lucky , more pictures of images , and I need to add <unk> , so again , I went onto Facebook and <unk> , for five days , I found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to participate .
In Japan , to July , we opened the neighboring towns of <unk> , far beyond north to town .
Every week , we installed our scanner in the temporary library that has setup before , so people come to reclaim their photos .
The older women who have never seen a scanner , but after 10 minutes , looking for your photo photo , give us to scan , upload a cloud server , to download by a <unk> , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and start to be edited .
Time has spent to restore the state is a completely different story , and obviously it depends on the harmful level of the image .
It might take one hour . It could take a week .
It could take months .
The <unk> in this picture is almost <unk> by hand , or <unk> , from parts of colors and details and other detail .
It takes time .
Now , all these images were broken , <unk> in the saltwater , covered in the water , covered in the water , sometimes a while , so they would continue to <unk> . So clean them was a very large part of the project .
We can &apos;t fix if we &apos;re not clean , dry and retrofits .
We &apos;ve got lucky with <unk> with hands .
There was a wonderful local woman who directed us .
It &apos;s very easy to harm these images .
My <unk> group once said it was like tattoo for somebody .
You don &apos;t have a <unk> chance .
The woman brought us these photographs , which was lucky , when they were able to recover .
She cleaned them up and stopped when he realized he was making more damage .
You also have a copy of the picture .
If not , the places like her husband and his face , it &apos;s never going to be able to be able to be able to , just put them together in another nice photo , and then <unk> the whole picture .
When we got photos from us , she shared a little bit of their story .
These pictures came from her husband who found at a fire department , between the cracks that were <unk> from the <unk> home , and they noticed him .
The day happens tsunami , you are responsible for the <unk> .
He had to go towards the channel as a <unk> hit .
These two little boys , no longer as a child , two of her sons are in school , two different schools .
One was stuck in the water .
<unk> a week , she found them and knew that they all survived .
The day I returned to her was that her son &apos;s son was 14 years old .
For her , after all , these photographs are the perfect gift to him , something it can look back , to remember the past , to remember the past that day , when the entire life was <unk> or destroyed .
After six months of Japan , <unk> volunteered joined <unk> <unk> , in which hundreds of people have <unk> cleaner <unk> in their photographs , mostly — — most photos came back to their boss , this is important .
Over the year , hundreds of global volunteers helped give more than 90 families , hundreds of photos that were completely recovered and correct .
In this time , we didn &apos;t spend a thousand dollars for the device and materials , most of the cost was to print the printer .
We were photographed all the time .
Each picture of somebody or something , a place , a relationship , a dear person .
They are the <unk> of our memories and our story , which is the last thing we &apos;re getting on <unk> and the first thing we &apos;re looking for .
It &apos;s the meaning of this whole project , restoring the tiny pieces of humanity , bringing those connections back to someone .
When a photograph like this is brought back , it will make a huge difference in people &apos;s lives .
The project also makes a big difference in the lives of the <unk> .
For some people , they were connected to something big , to go something , using their talents to something other than <unk> models and <unk> .
I &apos;d like to read one email to end this talk . This is from <unk> , one who helped edit with , sending me my day from Japan after six months .
&quot; When I work , I can &apos;t be thinking about myself and the stories that contain in pictures .
There was a photo photo , and a lot of the women in the house , from old age to young , gathers around a baby , hit me because I had a similar picture , Grandma , my mom , and my daughter , a picture on the wall .
At the other side , no matter what our basic needs are , right ? &quot;
Thank you .
I was close to <unk> underneath a <unk> mine in Ghana .
<unk> is <unk> and heat , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel a <unk> from the <unk> body <unk> through the dark , but it can &apos;t feel more .
Now , I hear this voice , but it &apos;s almost a mixture of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
So , as people , I wear a low-cost <unk> lamp on top of the head , and it &apos;s embedded in the old rubber rubber tube , and it &apos;s almost impossible to look at the walls of a <unk> hole against the walls of a <unk> hole .
As a <unk> , I <unk> the <unk> who saw a few days before <unk> fell down to the basement .
When I talk to you today , these people are still deep in that hole , risk of life without salaries or labor , and often die .
I was <unk> out of that hole , got home , but they would never be home , because it was <unk> .
In the last 28 years , I documented the local literature in over 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the honor to become the only gallery at the summit of peace at Vancouver .
Among the amazing people I met there , I met a support for the slavery <unk> campaign , an NGO of an NGO to the <unk> of modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and really , I began to learn about slaves because I knew that it existed in the world , but not so much .
So after the talk , I saw terrible and truly embarrassing for ignorance about this brutality in my life , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many people don &apos;t know ?
It began to <unk> <unk> , so a few weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> <unk> and offered them .
And from that beginning the journey in the slavery world .
<unk> is before I &apos;ve been to most of these places .
Some places I refer to as my house .
But this time , I want to see the truth .
A <unk> <unk> tell us that there are over 27 million people being turned into slavery in the world today .
That &apos;s twice two people have been taken from Africa during the best trade of the Atlantic .
150 years ago , a <unk> had about three times the annual income of an American worker .
That &apos;s the equivalent of 50,000 U.S. dollars today .
But today , many of the families are <unk> as much as a <unk> <unk> .
Interestingly , slavery has a better return to 100 billion dollars a year worldwide .
A lot of people were fooled by <unk> made about good education , better work , just to see themselves being caught under <unk> <unk> , and not escape .
This is today &apos;s wealth for trade , the <unk> that the slaves produce value , but the person who produces it as garbage .
<unk> is almost everywhere in the world , though it &apos;s illegal everywhere .
In India and Nepal , I was sent to a brick .
This beautiful landscape of view is like <unk> in the Egyptian Egypt or <unk> <unk> .
<unk> over the <unk> degrees , the men , the women , the whole family , all the <unk> in the bush , did the same thing , to 18 people every time , and brought them from the <unk> <unk> to the trucks that were there hundreds of meters .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> and <unk> , they shut up and over until 16 or 17 hours a day .
There &apos;s no food , there &apos;s no place to eat , because it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> and dust all over the place that my camera was so hot to impossible to touch the stop button .
I had to go back for 20 minutes , and I had to go back to the wild bike to wipe it up , and let them work under <unk> temperature , and when I was sitting there , I thought , my camera was also treated much better than those other people .
Just go back to the <unk> , I just wanted to cry , but the <unk> of <unk> beside <unk> <unk> me and said , &quot; Wow , don &apos;t do that . Don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
He explained that emotion is very dangerous in places like this , not with me , but with them .
I couldn &apos;t help them directly .
I didn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I &apos;m not the citizen .
I can take them into a worse situation .
I had to rely on the <unk> Station to <unk> them , and I believed they could .
For me , to wait until the home to really feel the pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw my children <unk> across multiple miles of mountain miles down the van waiting at the bottom .
The big rocks were heavy than the kids who brought them , the children lifted their children up using their heads using sticks from the plywood , rope and fabric .
<unk> these things are so heavy .
How do we create this demons , this is what &apos;s happening ?
Some people don &apos;t even know that they &apos;re <unk> , they work <unk> , 17 hours a day , because they &apos;re all over the world .
They have nothing to do .
When this village demanded freedom , <unk> <unk> their homes .
These people don &apos;t have anything , they die , they want to be there , but the women who are in the middle of their <unk> and they get their contract , so that they &apos;re still working down their <unk> , so that they &apos;re still doing their <unk> , but they &apos;re paid them , and they do it for free .
We tend to think about sex trade when we hear the word slavery , and because of this general sense , I get very hard to work in this particular business industry .
In <unk> , I was <unk> by women who were <unk> slavery .
They took me down to narrow stairs down the dirty basement , the <unk> light .
This is actually not a <unk> .
It &apos;s more like a restaurant .
The <unk> , as they know in the field , are the locations of the Mall <unk> .
Everywhere there are small rooms , where the slaves , women , babies and girls , are <unk> to customers , for example , they buy more wine and their food .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> by the number of paint on the wall by the <unk> and the curtain .
The person who &apos;s been doing this is routinely under <unk> <unk> .
<unk> in that particular corner , I remember feeling terrified , and that moment , I just understood what was locked inside of that <unk> .
There was only one way : staircase that word I came into .
There is no <unk> .
There was no big windows that came out .
These people don &apos;t have any escape , when we talk about the topic of difficulty , to remember that slavery , including slavery of sexual sales , also happens in the place where we live .
Thousands of thousands of people are <unk> in agriculture , in restaurants , full of <unk> in the houses , and the list is long .
Recently , The New York Times report that between 100,000 to 8,000 American children are sold for sexual slaves every year .
It &apos;s around us . We &apos;re just not seeing it .
Technology is often thought to be heard of slavery .
I went to many villages in India , where many families were <unk> under sales .
This is the family portrait .
<unk> <unk> were my father , blue hands and red were his sons .
They mix <unk> in big barrels , and they &apos;re embedded in that content that &apos;s linked to <unk> , although it &apos;s very toxic .
My version of storytelling .
They said , &quot; We don &apos;t have freedom .
But we still hope to be able to leave this house and go where we &apos;re being paid <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are still slave in the Himalayas , the largest prosthetic lake in the world .
Next time I went there , I went through a row .
I see the same thing as a family fishing on the boat , two brothers , some smaller boys , make sense ?
Wrong . They are all slaves .
Kids are taken away from the family , sales and loss , and being stopped <unk> on these boats here , no matter how to swim .
This is eight years old .
He <unk> when our boat came near , and she was scared of the boat on their tiny <unk> .
He was terrified of coming into the water .
The <unk> <unk> in the basement often hit fishing nets , and the kids are just tired of their fears being pushed into the water .
A lot of them were drowning .
What he missed , he was arrested .
The fear of the owner , I don &apos;t dare to flee , and because of <unk> from the <unk> , the child continues to go on smaller slaves that they manage .
I met these boys at five o &apos;clock in the morning , when they were pulling the last lines , but they worked from one hour .
at night night cold night .
<unk> that these nets are nearly <unk> when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you with you .
It was saved from a <unk> village .
I met him in the support of aid where the U.N. <unk> <unk> the recovery of slavery .
Where you are bathed in the <unk> , <unk> the water in the first place , and the great news is , when you and I sit here today , Dolly have been reunited with families , and rather , my family is given tools to earn and keep kids safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of the possibility .
How would you be if someone came up and changed their life ?
<unk> on the road in Ghana , the same colleagues in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , a friend of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on our car and knocked in the window .
He told us to follow the <unk> path in the forest .
At the end of the road he insisted us to leave the car , and drive the car away .
And just at this fuzzy spot and said , &quot; This is the aisle , this is the aisle . Go . &quot;
So , in that way , we mapped these <unk> <unk> , and after about one hour of the forest , the trace sunk in the water after the rains , so I took the tools to photograph when we went down to the breast level .
After two hours of <unk> , the traces around the <unk> <unk> , and in front of our eyes is a <unk> <unk> of the football field , they &apos;re full of slave workers .
Many women on their back in the back of gold , and they come through a <unk> water .
<unk> is used in the process of extraction .
These are the <unk> who are kidnapped in the mines in another area of Ghana .
When they got out of the basement , they were <unk> by their own sweat .
I remember looking at the red eyes , <unk> , because many people were under the ground to 72 hours .
The depth down to the depths of 100 meters , they <unk> onto heavy plastic bags to move them to another area , which is <unk> to get gold .
By looking at it , it seems to be full of healthy people , but when you look closer , there are fewer luck working in extreme situations , including children .
They were victims of damage , disease and violence .
In fact , many of the possibilities of this muscle will eventually be like this , tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years .
This is <unk> . When he died , he got his uncle to his <unk> .
When the uncle died , <unk> <unk> its debt , and was forced to have a slave in this mine for longer .
When I met , he worked for 14 years in the mine , and the wound on the foot was that this is from a victim in mine , a heavy wound to the doctor who said to saw .
After all , <unk> was sick , but she was still caught days day in the <unk> .
And yet , he still has a dream of his freedom to learn with the help of local activists like the <unk> <unk> , and the determination , like this , on the face of strangers , make me overwhelmed .
I want to give the slaves to light .
When I was working in this area , I brought a lot of candles , with the help of the translation , I was making the people who I photograph that I wanted to screen their stories and their circumstances , and then when they and I was safe and I took these pictures .
They know their pictures will be seen by the people out there .
I want them to know that we &apos;re going to prove them , and we will do anything that can help them change their lives .
I really believe , if we look at somebody else as human beings , it &apos;s very difficult to avoid <unk> of evil .
The images are not about themselves . They &apos;re about people , real people , like you and me , all equally equal to each other , honor and respect in their lives .
There was no day that I didn &apos;t think about these amazing people , I had tremendous honor to meet them .
I hope the images will form a powerful source of people , people like you , and hopefully that power will shine on the slavery , because there &apos;s no light , the monsters of imprisonment will continue to live in the dark .
Thank you very much .
